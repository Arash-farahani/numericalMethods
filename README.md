# Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering

Welcome to the "Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering" repository! This collection of resources is designed to support undergraduate chemical engineering students in their journey to grasp fundamental concepts and methods in numerical methods. The repository includes course lectures, supplementary tutorials, and MATLAB and Python code samples to demonstrate the practical implementation of these methods in engineering calculations.

## Course Overview

Our primary goal in this course is to equip you with essential skills in numerical methods, enabling you to apply them effectively to real-world engineering problems. To facilitate your learning, we've organized the course materials into the following sections:
